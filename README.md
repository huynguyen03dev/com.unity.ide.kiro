## Kiro Extension Installation

The Kiro extension marketplace does not yet support extensions needed for Unity development. To use this package with Kiro, you'll need to manually install the Unity IDE extensions:

1. Download **all** the `.vsix` files from: https://github.com/huynguyen03dev/Unity-IDE-Extensions
2. In Kiro, open the command palette with F1 or Ctrl+Shift+P
3. Search for and select "Extensions: Install from VSIX..." command
4. Install each `.vsix` file one by one
5. Make sure to install all the `.vsix` files from the repository for full functionality
6. Restart Kiro to complete the installation
